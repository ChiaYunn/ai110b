# Linear Recursive

## What's Recursive?
```
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression, and also the polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis.

The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.
The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even the categorical datas.
